# MissionControl
Repo for the Mission Control software used by Cosmic Research in its launchments.

You will need an Arduino Uno, running the [RadioReceiver](https://github.com/CosmicResearch/RadioReceiver) software, with a RFM69 transceiver connected via USB to your computer; and a RaspberryPi running our [GuidanceComputer](https://github.com/CosmicResearch/GuidanceComputer) software with the same transceiver connected.

This software will show you all the data sent by the RaspberryPi and, if you have a GPS connected, the location in a map.

We use this for our rockets launchments, but you can use it for whatever you want, like a drone or a boat.

##Build instructions
